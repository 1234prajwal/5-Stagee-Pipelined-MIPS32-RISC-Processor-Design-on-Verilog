# Design of 5 Stage Pipelined MIPS32 RISC Processor  
This repository contains the details and the code for the MIPS32 ISA based RISC Processor, which is implemented in 5 stage pipelined configuration.  

## ▫️ MIPS32  
- 32 x 32 bit GPRs [R0 to R31]  
- R0 hardwired to logic0  
- 32 bit Program Counter (PC)  
- No flag registers (carry, zero, sign..etc)  
- Few Addresing Modes  
- Only Load and Store instructions can access memory  
- We assume memory word size is 32 bits (word addressable)
